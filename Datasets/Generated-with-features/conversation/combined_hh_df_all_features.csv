76,"4,5,6,7","Is it not negligent to make sure the window is closed/access blocked? That's like driving down the road with the door open and blaming the kid when they fall out. In my view, a screen should provide enough security to allow the parents to leave the window open, you're analogy doesn't track. Perhaps they were just trying to keep their children's room cool on a balmy summer night. Accidents like this happen all the time. If you're intent on holding someone accountable then their really isn't anyone else to blame, but sometimes things just happen. If you live multiple stories up then you should not leave a window open and if you do access needs to be blocked. Screens are obviously not a deterrent. So yes I think that parents in this situation should be forced to take parenting classes. Most windows are up high enough on a wall that a child could not just walk through them. The child obviously stacked things inside the room to bring himself to window level and then pressed on the screen hard enough (this would take significant force on a properly installed screen) to fall through the window. The child was also four years old, right? At four, most children would have the presence of mind not to engage in such an activity. This is an odd circumstance all things considered.

76,"8,9,10,11","Hard to think about this situation for sure. We cannot really assume how high the window was or how intelligent the child is though. This is for the parents to do. Which brings me back to my point, if you know your kid has the ability to engage in such a behavior, take precautions. My little brother burnt our house down when he was 4. My parents always had child proof lighters after that. There are a ton of examples that can be used but it always comes back to the parents. I understand your point, but punishing the parents isn't going to bring the child back. I think that every parent could benefit from education on the basics of child rearing. Right so the ""punishment"" would be more bringing awareness to the parents. Rather than jail time/cps involvement you make them take parenting classes to prevent this from happening again. I'm pretty sure that they are very aware of the dangers following the events. The real shame is that humanity in general is a very reactive instead of a proactive entity.

So you have this strange dichotomy where more people need, or think they need, mental health help, which will push them towards things like mindfulness, while those same people do the exact opposite thing while engaging in their virtual worlds.

The internet, on the other hand, is potentially a coliseum of unhinged emotional responses to both real world and subjective events and opinions. I think you're absolutely correct.

No, meaningful action against this problem would require time, money, empathy and a sense of duty to ones fellow man that is very scarce in the world today.

At what point does ""help"" and ""sympathy"" becoming enabling and rationalizing?  When does trying to eliminate stigma becoming encouraging people to self-diagnose and use mental health as a crutch, or excuse. Well, help and sympathy are two mutually exclusive concepts. A lot of the time people who are experiencing intense isolation just need someone to talk to. I think that people who are actually diagnosed rely too heavily on prescription medication (which are only supposed to be a temporary crutch) and prefer to ignore the human element in therapy which is often the most beneficial. I'd agree with that.  In all parts of medicine, prescribing a pill has become the easy, satisfying thing to do.

Moving to another part of the country as some suggested in the article wouldn't seem to help these people. I agree there are no simple and clear solutions. Each case has its own set of needs which is why the process is so easily overwhelmed. They same could be said for the many Central Americans coming into the US. Although I take issue when the president claims they are rapist and gang members. Most immigrants just want a better life. I believe agree that most immigrants are wanting a better life. But for the issues facing the US, it's not the ones waiting in line and going through the immigration process that are the problem. It's the illegals that are crossing the border or being smuggled over that don't get a vetting process that is the problem. True, but our system is underfunded and overwhelmed as well. I live in Florida and know a few illegals-they are good people and contribute to my community. Not all illegals are bad. Those that want a better life and come here and live normal lives would be people that would most likely have been able to come into the country legally if we didn't have so many basically cutting the line. It is harsh but just like in the article in Germany, we can't take them all in. There has to be lines drawn and choices made. In the case of the illegals I know, they were desperate to provide for their families and so- I guess you're right-they cut in line. But I'm not sure they had a choice. their families were starving. I know there are hard choices to make. But there are plenty facing the same situation that don't cut in line. It's a tough issue for sure and no good solution.

I have heard about the bird issue just over the years in different settings.  It seems to be an ongoing issue for sure. I'd be interested to see how people felt if we just lay all the cards on the table.  Obviously we aren't this knowledgeable, but if we just said, ""These are the pros and cons of wind, solar, oil, nuclear, etc. what do the people prefer?""  In other words, what do you sacrifice?  Dead birds, cost, nuclear fears, Carbon dioxide/global warming, etc.  I'd be interested to see how people chose because, again, you have to compromise somewhere. Yeah totally.  It's easy for people to sit there and throw out idealistic notions but when it really came down to the practicality of it all and the pros and cons were laid out including cost, what would people choose Right.  And I also feel like we, the people, don't get to have that much say.  This is a larger conversation than we have time for, but my energy costs have spiked dramatically in the last few years because the energy company is going towards wind, and it's expensive.  I'm not saying that isn't what I'd ultimately choose, but I don't even get a choice.  I have one utility company and have to accept their monopoly. That is a good point as far as not getting any input.  Our costs have gone up too and we only have one company to choose from. The other thing I'd be interested about is what rodent populations are like around these wind farms.  If you kill all the birds of prey, how does that affect these lands for farming or grazing.  You wonder if land owners, who've agreed to have these wind turbines erected on their lands, will regret it. Oh yes true, ike the other populations will get out of control.  It could set the entire ecosystem out of balance.  Such is the danger when we tamper with nature.

207,"4,5,6,7","Right.  A narrative gets created and information either adds to it or gets disregarded.  For example, blacks are actually killed less often by police than whites based on encounter rates, but that piece of data has no place in politically-charged inflammatory subjects like this one.  Only emotions and strawmen do. I couldn't agree more. Just like more blacks kill one another than are shot by cops, but we make it out as if the only people killing black people are cops. I wish we would get a better representation of facts in the media to educate people. That was how media was supposed to work. These days it seems more like they simply want to grab headlines and push political agendas. Yeah, I think it's pretty sad.  The other thing I say to people is to use their own experiences to guide their beliefs more than stuff they see on screens.  How many hundreds of thousands of POSITIVE, PRODUCTIVE, LEGAL, and APPROPRIATE police encounters occur each day for every one that goes horribly wrong?  Again, a cop might shoot and murder an innocent civilian, but that's not our reality.  The event might be the truth.  But it's not representative of the true state of the nation and what the vast, vast, vast majority of people experience in their lives instead of on screens. I couldn't have said it better myself. We tend to take the extreme cases that make the headlines and make that the normal reality when it is far from the truth. I just recently saw a video of a black man with a knife. He was ordered to drop it and continued to advance on the cop. The man was shot several times, went down and then jumped back up. He attacked a second officer before he was finally taken down. That video didn't make headlines to show how often cops have little choice but to defend themselves.",0.13545066,-0.05452347,0.15686552,0.6194492,0.20704427,750,1.1077113711347613,19.067371484632663,-1.0767916137342328,0.006878830092476056,-0.004306765777185915,-0.002634413272662817,0.0027415449597830988,-0.008409118180569015,1.0

How close to certain death do we expect them to come before they're allowed to defend themselves?  I'm sorry but it's not hard to get a cop not to abuse you: do what he says.  They don't have any more desire to get violent than you do. I've said the same thing many times myself. I've had interactions with cops and never had any violence or threat of violence. If an officer asks you to do something, do it! That's what I was taught growing up. Respect authority figures. Instead, today everyone thinks they don't have to listen to anyone. They don't respect authority. They want to live stream it and get reactions on social media. Yes, that's the question I want answered.  It's not, ""Why are people getting shot by police?""  It's, ""Why is there a generation of people, and apparently predominantly blacks, who don't think they have to respect the law and law enforcement?"" I'm afraid it's what they are being taught by parents, social media and even music. They are told people are, ""out to get them"" and so they don't have to listen to anyone -- not just cops, but teachers and anyone in authority.

Heck, even parents, who often seem more intent on being friends than authority figures to their children. Well we don't enforce any rules on children anymore. We don't punish them. We give them time outs, as if that will teach them anything. I got spanked a few times growing up and I learned how to behave. Yes, some children were abused, but the majority of parents used spanking properly and taught children how to behave. Now, kids threaten to call CPS on parents if they don't get their way. Yes, I think it's sad an ironic.  I often wonder how a generation of people who were spanked but couldn't possibly believe they were abused, could go on to think spanking is so wrong.  I have a theory but it'd take too long to discuss here.  Just a weird irony, in my opinion. It is. It's like everything in society now, though.

We should be teaching people to be responsible and resilient, not to see themselves as victims. It's back to that everyone get's a trophy theory. We suddenly can't disappoint anyone. Life is full of disappointment. We can't always have our own way. We're supposed to live by the majority rules theory. However, even in politics we see people forget that. Instead, don't like the president, then refuse to accept him. It's crazy. I've voted for plenty of people that didn't win elections but still respected those that did. Absolutely.

In this case in particular, it's something she mentioned before so that makes it more likely to be true I think. It's really difficult because it's not like it's easy to prove things like this. Yeah totally.  It comes down to a ""he says, she says"" in so many cases.  I agree that the fact that she mentioned it at the time lends some credibility to the story.

Yes, and there have been a large number of terrorist incidents that were perpetrated by Muslims.  So to me, that would explain why people are targeting Muslims in retaliation.

Just mind their own business and enjoy their lives. Yes, I don't want to present too cynical and callous a view.  People can form stable societies.  But our current one likes to highlight differences and perceived inequalities, and that feeds a very antagonistic culture.

There aren't enough resources or competence to properly deal with the issue.  And there's probably corruption, too. Yeah for sure as easy as it seems there is so much ground for them to cover and animals to protect.

I think at best the rangers just now no they must be careful with that village. Yes, that's a good point.  Unfortunately, I think it only serves to embolden and legitimize their actions.  If there are no repercussions for waging ""war"" on anti-poaching, then how can the anti-poaching side ever have any real authority and success? Definetely it sends the message that if you want to poach then just make sure that the nearest village is benefiting from it and you wont need to worry. Maybe the government sends people to the villages to work as police or peacekeepers of some sort but that could just make tensions worse. Yeah, if nothing else I'd certainly be nervous to be the guy sent there, seeing how they treated these rangers.  I feel like you'd probably have to convince people associated with poaching that there's an economically viable alternative to their poaching.  The problem is that I'm not sure what that is in Mozambique. Yeah me either, it seems like all these people see is the money lost from not poaching. It feels bad but maybe there should be incentives for villages if the population of poached animals gets above a certain point? Yes, that's certainly an idea.  I think it's just human nature.  It's Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs.  We can entertain ideas of democracy and harmony and enlightenment and whatever, so long as we're fed and clothed and housed.

There kids actually learn, experience, have one on one help and concentrate not only on studies but encouraging them to be great human beings.  Public schools now are full of bullies and teaching to a test. They have been that way for at least the past twenty years. Teaching kids what to think instead of how to think. Also, having been a part of a ""gifted"" program throughout primary school the makes a concerted effort to intellectually segregate public schools. It does.  My daughter was in gifted.  We called it the ""little yellow schoolhouse"" because it was a building separate from the school.   What an experience and jumpstart both of you had in pursuing goals and futures.

You believe in order and stability, just like I and everyone else does.  But in some cases I prefer order over security and stability, or vice versa.  Many of our controversial issues boil down to that.  It's unfortunate that people can't see that underneath it all we actually share the same basic values. I can agree with that.
