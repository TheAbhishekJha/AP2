Certainly the bears will change something to try to survive, although the Arctic doesn't give them too many options, probably. I share your concern for the polar bears. It's heartbreaking to think about their struggles. I think it's interesting that biologists are studying their behavior in response to the changing sea ice. They're finding that some bears are changing their diet, hunting seals in the water rather than on the ice, which is actually more energetically expensive for them. Others are having trouble breeding because they're not getting enough food during the summer months when they're fasting on land. It's a really difficult situation I wonder if we can even do anything about it?  Even if we decrease CO2 production, their environment might continue to melt away. I think that's a fair question. While reducing CO2 emissions is crucial, it's a complex issue. However, I do think there are steps we can take to help polar bears adapt. For example, we could work on creating more corridors for them to move between areas with more stable sea ice. Or, we could support research into developing new technologies to help them hunt and survive on land.

I think that's a great idea. Regulation is definitely necessary, especially when it comes to something as potentially hazardous as amusement park rides. And it's not just about regulation, but also about accountability. If a theme park has a history of mechanical issues or safety concerns, they should be held accountable and take steps to address them. Like some sort of weekly checks.  It should not be a deadly situation. I completely agree. Regular inspections and checks should be a standard procedure for all theme parks. It's not too much to ask for our safety, is it?

The key is to learn from this tragedy and use it as a teaching moment to educate others about the importance of safety measures, especially in high-rise apartments. Maybe we can also explore ways to make windows safer for young children, like window guards or stops, rather than just focusing on punishing If you live multiple stories up then you should not leave a window open and if you do access needs to be blocked. Screens are obviously not a deterrent. So yes I think that parents in this situation should be forced to take parenting classes. I understand your point about taking responsibility for safety, but let's not forget that parents are human beings, not superheroes. We all make mistakes, and sometimes those mistakes have devastating consequences. The fact that the window was left open is a tragic oversight, but it's not necessarily a malicious one.

My parents always had child proof lighters after that. There are a ton of examples that can be used but it always comes back to the parents. I'm not disputing the importance of parents taking responsibility for their child's safety, but let's not assume that this is solely a matter of parenting. What if we acknowledge that 2-year-olds are naturally curious and prone to exploring their environment? Maybe instead of just blaming the parents, we can use this tragic incident to raise awareness about the importance of childproofing and safety measures in high-rise apartments. Right so the ""punishment"" would be more bringing awareness to the parents. Rather than jail time/cps involvement you make them take parenting classes to prevent this from happening again. That's a step in the right direction. I think we can do better than just punishment, though.

You know, I think it's time for social media companies to take a more active role in promoting mental health and well-being. We need to see some concrete steps from them to mitigate the harm caused by their platforms. I think it's not just about providing online counseling services, but also about promoting positive content and fostering a culture of empathy and understanding.

As individuals, we can also play a role by being more mindful of our own social media use and the impact it has on our mental health. Thats a good idea! Maybe if there were someway to monitor the emotional state of the user and limit the activity based on that. What do you think? I think that's a step in the right direction. But I also think we need to be careful not to stigmatize or shame users for their mental health struggles.

Not saying there's a direct causation there, but I don't think pervasive internet and social media has been good for children's (or anyone's) mental health. That's a valid point, but I think it's also about how we as a society are handling stress, relationships, and expectations.

By sharing stories like this and having open conversations about the ethics of zoos and animal welfare, we can create a cultural shift in how we think about these issues. What do you think? We need three more turns, actually. I think you're right, and it's not just about donating money. While financial support is crucial, it's also about spreading the word and raising awareness about the importance of animal welfare.

Are you concerned that the Houthis are backed by Iran, and are being used by Iran to increase their influence in the region? That's a valid concern, but let's not forget that the situation is more complex than a simple proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran. The Houthis are a domestic Yemeni movement with their own grievances and motivations, which have been exploited by Iran for its own interests. We should be cautious not to view this conflict solely through the lens of the Saudi-Iran rivalry, but rather consider the Yemeni people's needs and aspirations. I think it's pretty clear the Iranians are involved.  They're fighting proxy wars all over the place.  They're an existential threat to Israel, our top alley in the region.  Besides, when (not if) they get a nuke, plus ICMBs, they present a threat to a huge chunk of the world, far beyond the region, including possibly us through a suitcase bomb or dirty bomb. I understand your concerns about Iran's involvement and its potential threats to regional and global security. However, let's not forget that the conflict in Yemen is primarily a domestic issue, and the international community should focus on finding a peaceful resolution that addresses the Yemeni people's needs, rather than solely on the proxy war aspect. The Saudi-led coalition's actions have only exacerbated the humanitarian crisis, and it's time to re-evaluate their strategy.

Moreover, it's essential to recognize that Iran's influence in Sure, but they're OUR cockroaches.  Also, I'm sorry, but Iran is truly bad.  I understand the the US does bad stuff, but it's not state-sponsored terrorism like Iran.  We're not the bad guys in the world.  I know that post-911 and post-Iraq we often like to think we're really the bad guys.  But no, Iran is bad.  Russia is bad.  China is bad.  North Korea is bad.  There are levels of bad, and these guys are the worst. I understand your perspective, and I'm not trying to downplay the threat that Iran poses. However, let's not conflate the situation in Yemen with a global ideological conflict. The Yemeni people are not just pawns in a game between Iran and Saudi Arabia, but rather, they're the ones who are suffering the most. By viewing this conflict solely through the lens of the great power rivalry, we risk ignoring the human cost and the complexities of the situation.

And the people who are in positions to utilize this growth are against immigration. Could help everybody if we just worked together. That's a really astute observation.

It's just so fundamental to me that in a relationship, both partners should have an equal say and respect each other's autonomy. I think that's one of the things that's so beautiful about love - it's about mutual support and trust, not control. I hope the women in Saudi Arabia are able to find freedom within the next 10 years, i feel they have bene suffering for a long time I completely agree, it's heartbreaking to think about the generations of women who have been living under this system. The fact that they're finally speaking out and demanding change is a testament to their strength and resilience. I think it's amazing that the hashtag #SaudiWomenWantToAbolishTheGuardianshipSystem went viral and that so many women are standing together to fight for their rights.

It's the illegals that are crossing the border or being smuggled over that don't get a vetting process that is the problem. I understand your concern about the illegals crossing the border, but let's not forget that many of those individuals are also fleeing violence, persecution, or poverty. We can't just label them as ""illegals"" without considering their stories and the reasons behind their actions. The vetting process can be flawed, and it's not always a simple matter of ""going through the line."" Many asylum seekers face trauma, exploitation, and uncertainty, making it difficult for them to access the process. Not all illegals are bad.

The media does have a way of selecting which stories to cover, which can create a skewed perception of reality. But in this case, the fact that these police shootings are happening with alarming frequency does suggest a deeper issue with the way our law enforcement agencies are operating.

207,"4,5,6,7","Right.  A narrative gets created and information either adds to it or gets disregarded.  For example, blacks are actually killed less often by police than whites based on encounter rates, but that piece of data has no place in politically-charged inflammatory subjects like this one.  Only emotions and strawmen do. I see what you mean. The media can create a narrative that resonates with our emotions, but it's essential to dig deeper and consider the data.

Again, a cop might shoot and murder an innocent civilian, but that's not our reality.  The event might be the truth.

How close to certain death do we expect them to come before they're allowed to defend themselves?  I'm sorry but it's not hard to get a cop not to abuse you: do what he says.  They don't have any more desire to get violent than you do. I get where you're coming from, but I think that oversimplifies the situation.

Many black people have been killed while following instructions, like in the case of Terence Crutcher, who was shot while walking towards his car with his hands up. The issue goes beyond individual interactions and into the systemic problems with police training and accountability.

I think it's a complex issue, and there's no one simple answer. But I believe that when people feel marginalized and disenfranchised, they're more likely to feel like they don't have to respect the law.

We should be teaching people to be responsible and resilient, not to see themselves as victims. I think that's a great point. The idea that people should be able to express themselves without offending others is a double-edged sword. On one hand, we value free speech and the ability to express our opinions without fear of reprisal. On the other hand, we need to be mindful of how our words and actions impact others. It's a delicate balance between promoting open dialogue and protecting people's feelings. Absolutely.

It's like we're creating a culture of entitlement, where people expect the world to cater to their needs and emotions, rather than teaching them to be resilient and responsible.

I think it's because I'm a naturally empathetic person, and I've had a lot of training in emotional intelligence and conflict resolution. I also think it's because I've experienced my own share of challenges and struggles, which has helped me develop a deeper understanding of the complexities of human emotions and behaviors. But I'm curious, how do you approach these kinds of conversations? What motivates you to engage with difficult topics like this? I think it's something that would take an immense amount of time and effort to mourn properly and then confront the emotions you are feeling with an open mind and a supportive network of friends/family. The process would be absolutely daunting at the outset, but people are pretty tenacious. That's so true. Healing from trauma is a long and difficult journey, and it's not something that can be rushed. It's interesting that you bring up the importance of having a supportive network - I think that's something that's often overlooked in situations like this. The community's response can be just as critical as the individual's own efforts in terms of recovery and healing. Do you think we can create a more supportive and understanding community, or is that a utopian ideal? Yeah, I lost a dear childhood friend seven years ago and i'm still processing the loss. It's really something to lose someone. I certainly wish her the best. I'm so sorry to hear that you lost your friend. It's never easy to process the loss of someone close to us. Losing someone to violence, like in this case, can be especially traumatic. It's great that you're acknowledging your emotions and taking the time to process them.

Definetely it sends the message that if you want to poach then just make sure that the nearest village is benefiting from it and you wont need to worry. Maybe the government sends people to the villages to work as police or peacekeepers of some sort but that could just make tensions worse. That's a good point, and it's a bit of a vicious cycle.

Yeah me either, it seems like all these people see is the money lost from not poaching.

Offering incentives for conservation efforts could be a powerful motivator.

On one hand, I want to shield them from the harsh realities of the world, but on the other hand, I think it's essential to be aware of what's going on and have a critical thinking mindset. I'm still figuring out how to balance that with being a responsible parent. How about you? that is a great way to do it. I will be doing the same its the only way to go. I think it's about finding a balance, you know? We want to protect them from the harsh realities, but also prepare them for the world they're growing up in. It's a tough decision, but I think it's essential to have open and honest conversations with them. yeah I personally have a niece who cut her wrists because she was bullied online. She no longer is allowed to have a phone because of that. My sister messed up letting her use the phone in the first place. I'm so sorry to hear that. The impact of social media on mental health is a topic that's really close to my heart. I can only imagine how worried your sister must be feeling. It's interesting that you bring up your niece's situation, because it highlights how social media can be both a source of harm and a reflection of our society's values. We need to talk to our kids about empathy, kindness, and what it means to be a good friend online. Kids just cant handle it at that age it becomes too much. I'm definitely taking your advice when my kids are of age and give them a flip phone. Better to be safe than sorry with social media! Its been a great talk. Have a great day! bye It was a really valuable conversation. I'm glad we could share our perspectives and connect on this issue.

But at the same time, we've made significant progress in reducing smoking rates, and I believe it's because of increased awareness about the health risks and the measures we've put in place to restrict smoking in public spaces. My grandfather had a '57 Chevy that didn't have seatbelts. You can still have open containers in Missouri. Our childhood hasn't disappeared yet. I think that's a good point. It's about finding a balance between personal freedom and the greater good. Just like how we've phased out seatbelts and open containers, we're now discussing restrictions on smoking in public spaces. It's all about progress and adapting to new information. That's actually an idea everyone could profit from. Imagine having to look service workers in the face and appreciate their contribution to society at large. That's a really insightful comment. It's funny how we often take people in service industries for granted, but they're the ones who are really holding everything together.

It's a personal journey that only she can take, and it's not something we can predict or dictate. I think it's more important that she's taking steps towards healing and accountability, rather than forgiveness. Yeah i think i would be angry at my parents forever. I can understand that. It's natural to feel anger and resentment when someone you trusted and loved has betrayed you in such a profound way. But for Amanda, she's already shown a lot of courage by speaking out and confronting her mother on national television. That takes a lot of strength and vulnerability. Forgiveness might be a long way off, but maybe she's taking the first steps towards healing and moving forward.

My heart goes out to the families and loved ones of the 33 miners who lost their lives. It's heartbreaking to think about the senseless loss of life and the impact it will have on their families. Did you find it helpful to talk to people or process your grief in We try to get together often. Did the article mention what they were actually mining for? I'm glad you're thinking about the miners' families and the impact of this tragedy. As for what they were mining for, I don't recall seeing that in the article. But I'm guessing it was coal, given the context of China's coal industry being one of the deadliest in the world.

It's a system that's designed to remove gas and dust from the air, reducing the risk of explosions. But, if the system fails, it's like a ticking time bomb. I think it's a combination of human error, inadequate maintenance, and systemic failures that led to this tragedy. It's not just a matter of one person or one company, but a broader issue with the industry as a whole. I wonder what the average age of a Chinese miner is. It's a sobering thought, isn't it? The mining industry is often associated with younger workers, but I'm sure the reality is that many miners are middle-aged men who are the primary breadwinners for their families. Their families are counting on them, and their loss is felt deeply. It's a harsh reminder of the risks they take every day to provide for their loved ones.

We need to hold our institutions accountable for creating a safe and respectful environment for all students, especially women. It is.  Kansas has been the same way - just excuse it all.   I found it interesting how first the legal team was saying innocent until proven guilty but clammed up when the additional ones came forward.  It then became no comment. That's a classic defense strategy - shift from ""innocent until proven guilty"" to ""no comment"" when the evidence mounts against them.

It's a vicious cycle – we need more women in power to drive change, but until then, we're stuck in this stagnation. They have been that way for at least the past twenty years. Teaching kids what to think instead of how to think. Also, having been a part of a ""gifted"" program throughout primary school the makes a concerted effort to intellectually segregate public schools. That's so frustrating. It's like we're creating a two-tiered education system, where some kids get access to better resources and opportunities, while others are left behind.

Seriously, people always fail to recognize these things.  Probably because they just read CNN and disregard actual facts.  Oh well, what can you do I think that's a problem with how we consume news and information. We tend to only listen to sources that confirm our existing views and ignore or dismiss anything that contradicts them. It's like we're living in our own bubbles, rather than engaging with different perspectives and really trying to understand what's going on.
