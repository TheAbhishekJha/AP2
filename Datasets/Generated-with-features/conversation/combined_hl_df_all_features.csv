My parents always had child proof lighters after that. There are a ton of examples that can be used but it always comes back to the parents.

Are you concerned that the Houthis are backed by Iran, and are being used by Iran to increase their influence in the region? That's one of the concerns, yes.  But isn't it true that the whole situation is way more complicated than just the Houthi's being backed by Iran?  There are a lot of factions and interests at play here, and it's hard to know exactly what's going on. I think it's pretty clear the Iranians are involved.  They're fighting proxy wars all over the place.  They're an existential threat to Israel, our top alley in the region.  Besides, when (not if) they get a nuke, plus ICMBs, they present a threat to a huge chunk of the world, far beyond the region, including possibly us through a suitcase bomb or dirty bomb. But don't you think that's a simplistic view?  I mean, the situation in Yemen is a lot more complex than just Iran vs. Saudi Arabia vs. Israel.  There are local factors and historical grievances at play that are being ignored in the broader conflict. Sure, but they're OUR cockroaches.  Also, I'm sorry, but Iran is truly bad.  I understand the the US does bad stuff, but it's not state-sponsored terrorism like Iran.  We're not the bad guys in the world.  I know that post-911 and post-Iraq we often like to think we're really the bad guys.  But no, Iran is bad.  Russia is bad.  China is bad.  North Korea is bad.  There are levels of bad, and these guys are the worst. I agree that there are levels of bad, but I think we need to be careful not to generalize or stereotype entire countries or groups of people.  Just because the US has done some questionable things, it doesn't mean we're inherently bad.  And it's not necessarily accurate to say that Iran, Russia, or China are the worst.  Each country has its own complex history, politics, and motivations.  I'm not saying we should ignore the fact that they've done bad things, We should do more with them, I think.  Not a hot war, where the ramifications are too great though.  See, I'm realistic too.  Anyway, interesting chat.  Thanks.  bye Yeah, it was interesting.

The Thula Thula Rhino Orphanage is doing such important work in trying to protect and care for these incredible creatures. My family spoils their dogs rotten. I don't think they could be happier with their position in life, and that makes me glad. I volunteer as a foster pet parent and developing a bond of trust with a troubled pup is one of the most rewarding things. What kind of dogs do you have? I'm glad to hear that you have a good experience with animals. As for me, I don't have any pets, but I've had the chance to see rhinos up close through conservation efforts and it's truly an incredible experience. I think what the people at the Thula Thula Rhino Orphanage are doing is even more impressive, taking care of these orphaned rhinos and fighting to protect their species. Yeah, it's really hard to let them go. I'm reassured by knowing that they are being sent to a happy home where they will be loved and cared for. It's great to hear that.

I feel that efforts need to be made to solve the problems in the countries people are fleeing to help a larger number of people and reduce the burden on other countries like in Germany that are often overwhelmed by those seeking a safer place to live. That's a great point, and it's a complex issue. It's not just about immigration policies, but also about addressing the root causes of why people are leaving their home countries in the first place. The article mentions that the Nigerian man, Daniel Owolabi Ajibade, was fleeing a cartel that was threatening him because of his business, but also mentions that the problems with Boko Haram are mostly in the north.

Moving to another part of the country as some suggested in the article wouldn't seem to help these people. I agree there are no simple and clear solutions. Each case has its own set of needs which is why the process is so easily overwhelmed. I completely agree with that. The article mentions that even Syrians, who are generally given asylum more easily, are starting to have their claims rejected more often. It's clear that the system is under a lot of pressure and struggling to keep up with the number of applications. It's a very complex issue, and it's not just about accepting or rejecting asylum seekers, but also about the broader implications for the country and the individuals involved. I believe agree that most immigrants are wanting a better life. But for the issues facing the US, it's not the ones waiting in line and going through the immigration process that are the problem. It's the illegals that are crossing the border or being smuggled over that don't get a vetting process that is the problem. I understand your point. The article does mention that some politicians in Germany are arguing that some migrants are applying for refugee status based on flimsy evidence and come for economic reasons, which is a concern. However, it also raises questions about the fairness of the system and whether those who are genuinely fleeing danger are being swept up in a broader policy to restrict immigration. Not all illegals are bad. Those that want a better life and come here and live normal lives would be people that would most likely have been able to come into the country legally if we didn't have so many basically cutting the line. It is harsh but just like in the article in Germany, we can't take them all in. There has to be lines drawn and choices made. I think that's a fair point. The article does mention that some migrants in Germany are being rejected not just because of their nationality, but also because their claims are deemed not to be strictly related to war or political persecution. It raises questions about the fairness of the system and whether those who are genuinely fleeing danger are being swept up in a broader policy to restrict immigration. I know there are hard choices to make. But there are plenty facing the same situation that don't cut in line. It's a tough issue for sure and no good solution.

And in these high-population, low-wealth countries, they focus on much more basic goals.  Sort of like a Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs thing.

That's a pretty insightful observation. I think sometimes people do blame others or circumstances to avoid taking responsibility for their own actions. In this case, the man who shot the dog might be trying to justify his actions by saying he was acting in self-defense, but it's hard to see how shooting a dog is a proportional response to a dog jumping up to play. if you're not a in control, take charge type, you can just say look at what you did, you did something wrong, you fix it. You pay for it, because its beyond my control. Exactly, taking responsibility for one's actions is a much more mature and respectful way of handling a situation. And in this case, the man could have taken a more proportional response to the situation, like I said earlier.

It was a comprehensive piece of legislation that aimed to reduce crime and violence in the US.  It's still a topic of debate today, but at the time it was seen as a major achievement in addressing domestic crime. Okay.  Do you think the crime bill was driven by malice or just ignorance? I think it was a combination of both.  On the one hand, some provisions of the bill, such as the ""three strikes"" law, were clearly driven by a punitive mindset.  On the other hand, the bill also included some progressive provisions, like the ban on assault weapons and the increase in funding for crime prevention programs.

Maybe the government sends people to the villages to work as police or peacekeepers of some sort but that could just make tensions worse. That's a concern, and it's a delicate situation. The government would need to tread carefully when introducing any new initiatives to prevent further escalation.

That's a valid point. Just as you might feel uneasy around someone openly carrying a gun, some people might feel uneasy around smokers in public spaces.

That's a great point, but the issue here is more about setting a precedent and normalizing a certain behavior in children.
